            <h2>What Are Internet-Based Ads?</h2>
            <p>
                Internet-based ads are personalized ads that are shown to you based on your browsing activities across various websites. We, along with third-party partners, collect information about your visits to these sites to display more relevant ads.
            </p>
            <h2>Your Choices Regarding Ads</h2>
            <p>
                You can opt out of receiving internet-based ads by adjusting your browser settings or visiting the opt-out pages of third-party advertisers. However, you will still see ads, but they may not be as relevant.
